# Are we High On Dopamine ?

## We are Addicted 

We humans always fall for addiction , some people are addicted to drugs , some to eating unhealthy food ,some to watching tv ..... this goes on and on . For me i am addicted to coffee. So why do we get addicted to things ? Its because of dopamine . Our brain likes Dopamine so it will make you do things you know are unhealthy.In today's world everything is so  acessible that its easy to satisfy your need of dopamine.We are always high on dopamine. Instant rewards Instant Dopamine ! . We seek instant rewards its as small as getting a like or comment on our photos.We currently live in a world where it is easy to waste time.Most of the time you take the roads that are easy and give instant reward. I could spend time writing a website from scratch or i could just use a theme and instantly host my site to show it to the world. 

## The negatives 

Once you get addicted to such high level of dopamine, your brain will want more and won't take no for an answer . The main reason it is hard for a druggie to live a sober life. Reading books doesn't give you instant reward but watching movie surely does.

## What are you gonna do about it!

I am thinking about going offline and doing stuffs that don't release dopamine once a month. No mobile ,No Laptop :( , I get bored easily when i read books on philosophy so i will read them !
